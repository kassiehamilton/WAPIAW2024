# Overview

This repository contains the code for the analyses and visualization performed in the manuscript "The neuroimaging correlates of depression established across six large-scale datasets", [preprint available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.02.660888v1). In this project, we used a linear mixed effects model to relate depression to imaging derived phenotypes from structural and resting state functional MRI data within each dataset. We then performed a meta analysis to establish the neuroimaging correlates of depression across 23,417 participants from six large datasets. It is important to note that data is not shared in this repository, as data sharing is in conflict with data use agreements of dataset providers. However, how data may be obtained from dataset providers is detailed in the "data availability" statement below.
